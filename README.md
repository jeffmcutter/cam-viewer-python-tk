# cam-viewer-python-tk

For viewing images collected with time stamps.

I wrote this quite a while back to view images collected from my IP cameras one after another and enable me to save and archive them.

This one is as the name indicates in Python Tk, I had previously written it in Perl Tk which is also available here (cam-viewer-perl-tk).
